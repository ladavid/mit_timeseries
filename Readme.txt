Example code explaining normalization and detrending methods used in
David et al., Genome Biology 2014. In effort to make these examples as
easy to understand as possible, these notebooks use partially
simplified versions of our analysis code. Please contact Lawrence
David (l.d@duke.edu) for full and up-to-date versions of the analysis
libraries, as well as with any questions, comments, or bug reports.
